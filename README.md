Thank you for purchasing our iOS™ A330 System Reset Pro App.  We hope that you have a trouble-free experience with this app, but in case you come across any problems we have put together a few suggestions to help you along the way.

Purchase, Download & Installation:

You should be aware that these processes are completely controlled by Apple™ on the iTunes™ Store and these activities are completely beyond our control.  When you purchase one of our products from the store you will be permitted to install it on all your iOS devices that carry your common Apple ID . If you accidentally delete/uninstall the app or you change device, you may re-install it from iTunes at no charge.(If the Apple ID is the same). Previously installed Apps you can found in the “Purchased' page of iTunes.  This app is not time-limited. 
If Apple detects that installation process has failed, you may be asked to repeat the purchase process again.  NOTE: You cannot be charged twice. 
Please do not contact us with queries about payments, we do not get any information from Apple until payment transaction is finished, so we cannot help. Queries regarding payments and failed installations should be directed to the iTunes Store.

It is recommend that you make full use of iCloud (or other backup) to ensure your device content can be restored. 

Apple have very strict vetting process for applications that they offer for sale.  Having passed an application as compliant with their policies it is not unknown for Apple to later withdraw that application from sale, without notice, because of some change in their internal policies.  You may also be aware that Apple have the ability to remotely erase application(s) from a user's device.  With this in mind it is impossible for us to guarantee the continued availability of a purchase where the device provider retains ultimate control over the device content.
